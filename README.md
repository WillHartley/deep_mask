Contributors: Will Hartley (William.Hartley@unige.ch)

Repo for constructing observed properties of galaxy populations (photometry) following a set of SEDs and luminosity function(s).

## What does the code do

Draws redshift and luminosity values from a luminosity function, assigns an SED and computes photometry.

## File structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

* examples
* notebooks


## Getting started

Here is an example
